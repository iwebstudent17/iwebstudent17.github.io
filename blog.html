                <p>Rappin' For Jesus lri [Verse 1: Jim Colerick]
                    Well, I wrote this song for the Christian youth
                    I wanna teach kids the Christian truth
                    If you wanna reach those kids on the street
                    Then you gotta do a rap to a hip-hop beat
                    So I gave my sermon an urban kick
                    My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick
                    My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
                    That's 'cause Jesus Christ is my
                    Woo!

                    [Verse 2: Jim Colerick]
                    He's a life-changer, miracle arranger
                    Born to the virgin mom in a manger
                    Water to wine, he's a drink exchanger
                    And he died for your sins
                    I preach the word, that's my gig
                    And I rhyme better than Notorious B.I.G
                    All the other MCs, I wish them well
                    But if you live in sin, you burn in
                    Now I'ma pass the mic to my lovely wife
                    She's a fly MC and the light of my life
                    So to bust a rhyme without further ado
                    Take it away, Mary Sue!

                    [Verse 3: Mary Sue]
                    Jesus Christ is my
                    He's the son of the original G
                    And he was sent to Earth to elucidate the way that we should be
                    (What?) Like if another MC says, "You're a freak!
                    You're a lame-butt rapper and your rhymes are weak!"
                    I don't get mad and I don't critique
                    I forgive him, and turn the other cheek
                    I don't blaspheme and I don't brag
                    I don't cuss, and my pants don't sag
                    I do exude a little Christian swag
                    And I'm proud to be an American!


                    [Hook: Both]
                    Jesus Christ is our
                    Let his light shine through ya!
                    Let his love pop a cap in your butt and say hallelujah

                    [Verse 4: Both]
                    Jesus Christ is our
                    He's a homie MC, JC, you see
                    He's an honest, caring, peace-loving like me
                    If you do drugs and you think you're cool
                    You need to come to Sunday school!
                    Put those drugs in a garbage can
                    Stand up tall, you're a Christian man!

                    [Outro: Jim Colerick and Mary Sue]
                    Word up!
                    I'm freestyling!
                    Hit me!.</p>
